# Final Project: Create a Real-World Web Application

## Overview
For this final project, you will apply the skills and concepts learned throughout the course to create a web application. The application must incorporate elements of Vue.js, state management using Pinia, and interact with external APIs for a functional and engaging user experience.

## Objectives
- Build a full-fledged web application that leverages the Vue.js framework.
- Implement state management effectively using Pinia.
- Utilize external APIs to enrich the functionality of your application.
- Incorporate best practices for code structure, reusability, and user experience.
- Deploy your application for public access.

## Project Ideas
Choose one of the following project ideas, or propose your own, which must be approved by the instructor:

1. **Recipe Finder Application**
    - Users can search for recipes using an external recipe API.
    - Features to save favorite recipes, create a shopping list, and meal planner.

2. **Fitness Tracker**
    - Create an application that tracks user fitness goals, daily activities, and progress.
    - Use external APIs to fetch exercise data and nutrition information.
    - Include data visualization components to present user statistics.

3. **Expense Tracker**
    - Build a multi-platform application for tracking income and expenses.
    - Implement features to categorize expenses, generate reports, and visualize spending trends using chart libraries.

4. **Object Recognition Game using TensorFlow**
    - Develop a scavenger hunt game where users collect objects identified through their camera using a TensorFlow model.
    - Use state management to track scores and object collection.

5. **Portfolio Website**
    - Create a personal portfolio that showcases projects and skills, utilizing a headless CMS like Storyblok for content management.
    - Implement a user-friendly interface with responsive design principles.

## Requirements
- Use **Vue.js** as the primary framework.
- Manage state with **Pinia**.
- Incorporate **external APIs** relevant to your application.
- Ensure a clean user interface, employing a UI library such as **Vuetify** or **Quasar**.
- Provide a README file that explains how to run your application, the technologies used, and any setup instructions.
- Deploy your application on a platform such as **Netlify**, **Vercel**, or **GitHub Pages**.

## Submission Guidelines
- Submit your code via a GitHub repository link.
- Ensure your repository includes:
    - Well-commented code.
    - A complete README file.
    - Screenshots or a demo link of your functioning application.
- Present your project in class, highlighting the features and technologies you've employed.

## Timeline
- **Week 1-2**: Project proposal and planning phase.
- **Week 3-5**: Development phase. Regular check-ins with the instructor.
- **Week 6**: Deployment and presentation preparation.
- **Week 7**: Final presentations.

## Evaluation Criteria
Projects will be evaluated on:
- Functionality: Does the application work as intended?
- Code Quality: Is the code clean, well-structured, and commented?
- User Experience: Is the UI intuitive and user-friendly?
- Presentation: How well do you explain your project and demonstrate its use?
